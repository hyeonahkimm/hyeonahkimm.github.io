**Ph.D. Candidate in Industrial and Systems Engineering at KAIST**

I am a member of the <a href="http://silab.kaist.ac.kr/" style="color: #7289da; text-decoration: none;">Systems Intelligence Lab</a> (advised by Prof. Jinkyoo Park) and <a href="https://comet.kaist.ac.kr/" style="color: #7289da; text-decoration: none;">Computational Optimization Methods Lab</a> (co-advised by Prof. Changhyun Kwon). My research focuses on machine learning for practical combinatorial optimization, *e.g., large-scale vehicle routing problems, hardware design optimization, and molecular optimization*. Here is my <a href="https://hyeonahkimm.github.io/assets/cv.pdf" class="link-in-list" style="color: #7289da; text-decoration: none;"> cv</a>.
